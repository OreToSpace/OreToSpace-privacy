      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        OreToSpace is a mobile game. We use third-party services for analytics and advertising to understand app performance
        and show rewarded ads. This policy explains what data may be collected, why, and how it is used.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Data we collect</h2>
      <p>The app may collect or share the following categories of data (directly or via integrated SDKs):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong> (e.g., installation identifiers, advertising identifiers where available).</li>
        <li><strong>Approximate location</strong> (typically derived from IP address, such as country/city level).</li>
        <li><strong>App activity</strong> (e.g., interactions with ads such as viewing or completing a rewarded ad).</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong> (crash reports, performance data, and related technical information).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> ask you to create an account, and we do <strong>not</strong> knowingly collect
        your name, email address, phone number, or precise location through the game.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
